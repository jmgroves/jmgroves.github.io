    <h1><em>Jared's Blog</em></h1>
    <p>Ok! So here we go. This blog will hopefully track my learning and
      progression throughout this course, so let's give it a go.</p>

    <p>Firstly, I've already done a fair amount of prework when it comes to
      learning the basics of programming in java, so this will be a bit of a
      refresher.</p>
    <p>I learned tht a void declaration in a method is used when you don't want
      a return value from that particular method. Mainly for things that are just
      supposed to "do" something rather than calculate something and give a return.
      Things like printing a menu of selections, or executing a series of functions.
      Not things like "hey, what's the area of this square with side length 12?"
    </p>
    <p>I learned that the difference between a paramater and a function is pretty
      simple, yet still kind of hard to grasp. Essentially, a parameter is the
      variable in the declaration of the function, whereas the arguement is <thead>
        <em>actual</em> value passed through to the arguement. For example,
        if this function needed variable sideLength to calculate the area
        of a square and return, the variable sideLength would be the parameter
        and the actual value, be it 10, 12, 15, 100000 is the arguement.</p>
      </p>
      <p>When you cast a double to an int, you are forcing it into something else, truncating, or cutting off
      all the decimal places after the integer itself, so 10.99999 would become
      just plain 10. One way I could see myself using this is when a double
      has been used for all sorts of calcuations, but I don't need the answer
      to be insanely precise, just thereabouts, I can cast the double to an int
      before printing it to the user.</p>
      <p>When I get frustrated and discouraged, sometimes it can really bog
        me down and put me into a nonproductuve state of mind. One thing
        I try to do when I recognize I'm slipping down like that is to take a small
        break, clear my head, and think about something else for a few minutes.
        I have learned that spending 3 hours banging my head against the wall trying
        to figure something out is often times less productive than taking a 30 min
        break and coming back to it. I feel taking the break, even though you aren't
        directly working at it, allows you to complete the task with much less
        time taken and heartache later.</p>
        <p>The difference between a while and a do-while loop is very simple.
          a while loop will check the condition <strong>before </strong> executing
          the body, and if the condition is false before coming to the loop, will
          not even run the body once. A do-while loop will check the loop condition
          <strong> after </strong> executing the body of the loop.</p>
